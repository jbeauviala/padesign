# Ignore everything by default
*

# But keep the .gitignore itself (important for new clones)
!.gitignore

# Keep the root-level HTML entry point
!index.html

# Keep the entire assets directory and everything under it
!assets/
!assets/**

# (Optional) â€“ if you want to exclude build artefacts *inside* assets
# you can re-ignore them below, e.g.:
#  assets/css/tailwind.css.map
#  assets/**/temp/
